<div><h2>About NIST CSF</h2>
<p>
The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) is a voluntary framework designed to help organizations protect their information systems from cyber attacks. The framework provides a comprehensive set of guidelines and best practices that organizations can use to manage their cybersecurity program. It was developed in response to the growing number of cyber threats and the need for organizations to be better prepared and more resilient.
</p>
<p>
The framework provides organizations with a structure for assessing their cybersecurity risk and identifying areas for improvement. It includes five core components: Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, and Recover. Each component covers a range of activities and objectives that organizations need to consider in order to effectively manage their cybersecurity program.
</p>
<p>
The Identify component helps organizations understand the scope and nature of their information systems and the associated risks. The Protect component focuses on security controls, policies, and procedures that should be implemented to reduce risk. The Detect component focuses on monitoring the environment and detecting any potential threats. The Respond component focuses on identifying the appropriate response to a threat and responding accordingly. Finally, the Recover component focuses on restoring systems and data to an acceptable state.
