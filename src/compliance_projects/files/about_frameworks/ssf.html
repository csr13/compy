<div><h2>About SSF</h2>
<p>
The SSF (Startup Security) framework is a set of security controls designed for startups to quickly and effectively set up their environment. The controls are rather opinionated and will suggest specific tooling. The tooling and environment recommendations are not required, but the standard is designed to reduce the amount of decisions that a startup must make. The controls are also roughly in order and it is recommended to start with control 1 (e.g. ssf1) and go down the list. The order is not mandatory but it makes the most sense for dependencies. There are a total of 20 controls in the framework and if all 20 controls are completed, your security risk will be greatly reduced. The SSF framework also works nicely with other large name frameworks such as CSC, NIST, CMMC (in other words, there is nothing in SSF that would be frowned upon in other frameworks).
