<div><h2>About PCI DSS</h2>
<p>
The PCI DSS framework is a set of rules and regulations created by the Payment Card Industry Security Standards Council (PCI SSC). It applies to any organization that processes, stores, or transmits credit card data, and is intended to help ensure the security of such data. The PCI DSS is composed of 12 requirements that cover topics such as encryption, access control, and logging and monitoring. The requirements are organized into six categories, including security management, access control, encryption, and incident response. The PCI DSS framework helps organizations identify and address potential security risks, and is an essential component of any organizationâ€™s security posture.
