The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) security framework is an important set of guidelines for ensuring the privacy and security of protected health information (PHI). HIPAA was enacted in 1996 and was designed to protect the privacy of individualsâ€™ health information, as well as promoting the safe and secure handling of such information.
The HIPAA security framework is composed of two parts: the Security Rule and the Privacy Rule. The Security Rule requires organizations to implement safeguards to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of PHI. It requires that organizations implement technical, physical, and administrative security measures to ensure the security of PHI. These measures include:
  <ul>
    <li>Encryption of PHI stored on computers and mobile devices</li>
    <li>Limiting access to PHI to authorized personnel only</li>
    <li>Implementing access control measures to prevent unauthorized access to PHI</li>
    <li>Auditing access to PHI on a regular basis</li>
  </ul>
</p>
<p>
In addition to the security measures, the Privacy Rule mandates that organizations must obtain written authorization from patients before they can use or disclose their PHI. The Privacy Rule also outlines the rights of individuals to access, inspect, and amend their PHI.
