<h2>Purpose and Scope</h2>
<ul>
<li>This data classification policy defines the requirements to ensure that information within the organization is protected at an appropriate level.</li>
<li>This document applies to the entire scope of the organization&rsquo;s information security program. It includes all types of information, regardless of its form, such as paper or electronic documents, applications and databases, and knowledge or information that is not written.</li>
<li>This policy applies to all individuals and systems that have access to information kept by the organization.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Background</h2>
<ul>
<li>This policy defines the high level objectives and implementation instructions for the organization&rsquo;s data classification scheme. This includes data classification levels, as well as procedures for the classification, labeling and handling of data within the organization. Confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements maintained by the organization must reference this policy.</li>

</ul>
<h2>Policy</h2>
<ul>
<li>If classified information is received from outside the organization, the person who receives the information must classify it in accordance with the rules prescribed in this policy. The person thereby will become the owner of the information.</li>
<li>If classified information is received from outside the organization and handled as part of business operations activities (e.g., customer data on provided cloud services), the information classification, as well as the owner of such information, must be made in accordance with the specifications of the respective customer service agreement and other legal requirements.</li>
<li>When classifying information, the level of confidentiality is determined by:
<ul>
<li>The value of the information, based on impacts identified during the risk assessment process. More information on risk assessments is defined in the Risk Assessment Policy (reference (a)).</li>
<li>Sensitivity and criticality of the information, based on the highest risk calculated for each information item during the risk assessment.</li>
<li>Legal, regulatory and contractual obligations.</li>

<ul>
<li>Information must be classified based on confidentiality levels as defined in Table 3.</li>
<li>Information and information system owners should try to use the lowest confidentiality level that ensures an adequate level of protection, thereby avoiding unnecessary production costs.</li>
<li>Information classified as &ldquo;Restricted&rdquo; or &ldquo;Confidential&rdquo; must be accompanied by a list of authorized persons in which the information owner specifies the names or job functions of persons who have the right to access that information.</li>
<li>Information classified as &ldquo;Internal Use&rdquo; must be accompanied by a list of authorized persons only if individuals outside the organization will have access to the document.</li>
<li>Information and information system owners must review the confidentiality level of their information assets every five years and assess whether the confidentiality level should be changed. Wherever possible, confidentiality levels should be lowered.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>For cloud-based software services provided to customers, system owners under the company&rsquo;s control must also review the confidentiality level of their information systems after service agreement changes or after a customer&rsquo;s formal notification. Where allowed by service agreements, confidentiality levels should be lowered.</li>
<li>Information must be labeled according to the following:
<ul>
<li>Paper documents: the confidentiality level is indicated on the top and bottom of each document page; it is also indicated on the front of the cover or envelope carrying such a document as well as on the filing folder in which the document is stored. If a document is not labeled, its default classification is Internal Use.</li>
<li>Electronic documents: the confidentiality level is indicated on the top and bottom of each document page. If a document is not labeled, its default classification is Internal Use.</li>
<li>Information systems: the confidentiality level in applications and databases must be indicated on the system access screen, as well as on the screen when displaying such information.</li>
<li>Electronic mail: the confidentiality level is indicated in the first line of the email body. If it is not labeled, its default classification is &ldquo;Internal Use&rdquo;.</li>
<li>Electronic storage media (disks, memory cards, etc.): the confidentiality level must be indicated on the top surface of the media. If it is not labeled, its default classification is &ldquo;Internal Use&rdquo;.</li>
<li>Information transmitted orally: the confidentiality level should be mentioned before discussing information during face-to-face communication, by telephone, or any other means of oral communication.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>All persons accessing classified information must follow the guidelines listed in Appendix A, &ldquo;Handling of Classified Information.&rdquo;</li>
<li>All persons accessing classified information must complete and submit a Confidentiality Statement to their immediate supervisor or company point-of-contact. A sample Confidentiality Statement is in Appendix B.</li>
<li>Incidents related to the improper handling of classified information must be reported in accordance with the Security Incident Management Policy (reference (b)).</li>
</ul>
