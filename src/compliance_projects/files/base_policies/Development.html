<h2>Purpose and Scope</h2>
<ul>
<li>The purpose of this policy is to define requirements for establishing and maintaining baseline protection standards for company software, network devices, servers, and desktops.</li>
<li>This policy applies to all users performing software development, system administration, and management of these activities within the organization. This typically includes employees and contractors, as well as any relevant external parties involved in these activities (hereinafter referred to as &ldquo;users&rdquo;). This policy must be made readily available to all users.</li>
<li>This policy also applies to enterprise-wide systems and applications developed by the organization or on behalf of the organization for production implementation.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Background</h2>
<ul>
<li>The intent of this policy is to ensure a well-defined, secure and consistent process for managing the entire lifecycle of software and information systems, from initial requirements analysis until system decommission. The policy defines the procedure, roles, and responsibilities, for each stage of the software development lifecycle.</li>
<li>Within this policy, the software development lifecycle consists of requirements analysis, architecture and design, development, testing, deployment/implementation, operations/maintenance, and decommission. These processes may be followed in any form; in a waterfall model, it may be appropriate to follow the process linearly, while in an agile development model, the process can be repeated in an iterative fashion.</li>

<h2>Policy</h2>
<ul>
<li>The organization&rsquo;s Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) includes the following phases:
<ul>
<li>Requirements Analysis</li>
<li>Architecture and Design</li>
<li>Testing</li>
<li>Deployment/Implementation</li>
<li>Operations/Maintenance</li>
<li>Decommission</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>During all phases of the SDLC where a system is not in production, the system must not have live data sets that contain information identifying actual people or corporate entities, actual financial data such as account numbers, security codes, routing information, or any other financially identifying data. Information that would be considered sensitive must never be used outside of production environments.</li>
<li>The following activities must be completed and/or considered during the requirements analysis phase:
<ul>
<li>Analyze business requirements.</li>
<li>Perform a risk assessment. More information on risk assessments is discussed in the Risk Assessment Policy (reference (a)).</li>
<li>Discuss aspects of security (e.g., confidentiality, integrity, availability) and how they might apply to this requirement.</li>
<li>Review regulatory requirements and the organization&rsquo;s policies, standards, procedures and guidelines.</li>
<li>Review future business goals.</li>
<li>Review current business and information technology operations.</li>
<li>Incorporate program management items, including:
<ul>
<li>Analysis of current system users/customers.</li>
<li>Understand customer-partner interface requirements (e.g., business-level, network).</li>
<li>Discuss project timeframe.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Develop and prioritize security solution requirements.</li>
<li>Assess cost and budget constraints for security solutions, including development and operations.</li>
<li>Approve security requirements and budget.</li>
<li>Make &ldquo;buy vs. build&rdquo; decisions for security services based on the information above.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The following must be completed/considered during the architecture and design phase:
<ul>
<li>Educate development teams on how to create a secure system.</li>

<li>Create high-level non-technical and integrated technical security designs.</li>
<li>Perform a cost/benefit analysis for design components.</li>
<li>Document the detailed technical security design.</li>
<li>Perform a design review, which must include, at a minimum, technical reviews of application and infrastructure, as well as a review of high-level processes.</li>
<li>Describe detailed security processes and procedures, including: segregation of duties and segregation of development, testing and production environments.</li>
<li>Design initial end-user training and awareness programs.</li>
<li>Design a general security test plan.</li>
<li>Update the organization&rsquo;s policies, standards, and procedures, if appropriate.</li>
<li>Assess and document how to mitigate residual application and infrastructure vulnerabilities.</li>
<li>Design and establish separate development and test environments.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The following must be completed and/or considered during the development phase:

</ul>
</li>
<li>The following must be completed and/or considered during the testing phase:
<ul>
<li>Perform a code and configuration review through both static and dynamic analysis of code to identify vulnerabilities.</li>
