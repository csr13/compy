Note: SSL and early TLS are not considered strong cryptography and cannot be used as a security control after June 30, 2016.

        "description": "Sensitive information must be encrypted during transmission over public networks, because it is easy and common for a malicious individual to intercept and/or divert data while in transit. Secure transmission of cardholder data requires using trusted keys/certificates, a secure protocol for transport, and proper encryption strength to encrypt cardholder data. Connection requests from systems that do not support the required encryption strength, and that would result in an insecure connection, should not be accepted. Note that some protocol implementations (such as SSL, SSH v1.0, and early TLS) have known vulnerabilities that an attacker can use to gain control of the affected system. Whichever security protocol is used, ensure it is configured to use only secure versions and configurations to prevent use of an insecure connection-for example, by using only trusted certificates and supporting only strong encryption (not supporting weaker, insecure protocols or methods). Verifying that certificates are trusted (for example, have not expired and are issued from a trusted source) helps ensure the integrity of the secure connection. (Continued on next page) Generally, the web page URL should begin with \"HTTPS\" and/or the web browser display a padlock icon somewhere in the window of the browser. Many TLS certificate vendors also provide a highly visible verification seal- sometimes referred to as a 'security seal,' \"secure site seal,\" or 'secure trust seal')-which may provide the ability to click on the seal to reveal information about the website. Refer to industry standards and best practices for information on strong cryptography and secure protocols (e.g. NIST SP 800-52 and SP 800-57, OWASP, etc.) Regarding use of SSL/early TLS: Entities using SSL and early TLS must work towards upgrading to a strong cryptographic protocol as soon as possible.  Additionally, SSL and/or early TLS must not be introduced into environments where they don't already exist. At the time of publication, the known vulnerabilities are difficult to exploit in POS POI payment environments. However, new vulnerabilities could emerge at any time, and it is up to the organization to remain up-to-date with vulnerability trends and determine whether or not they are susceptible to any known exploits.

The requirement for reviewing applications or installing web-application firewalls is intended to reduce the number of compromises on public-facing web applications due to poor coding or application management practices. Manual or automated vulnerability security assessment tools or methods review and/or test the application for vulnerabilities Web-application firewalls filter and block non- essential traffic at the application layer. Used in conjunction with a network-based firewall, a properly configured web-application firewall prevents application-layer attacks if applications are improperly coded or configured. This can be achieved through a combination of technology and process. Process-based solutions must have mechanisms that facilitate timely responses to alerts in order to meet the intent of this requirement, which is to prevent attacks.

Criminals will also try to add 'skimming' components to the outside of devices, which are designed to capture payment card details before they even enter the device-for example, by attaching an additional card reader on top of the legitimate card reader so that the payment card details are captured twice: once by the criminal's component and then by the device's legitimate component. In this way, transactions may still be completed without interruption while the criminal is 'skimming' the payment card information during the process.

The type of inspection will depend on the device- for example, photographs of devices that are known to be secure can be used to compare a device's current appearance with its original appearance to see whether it has changed. Another option may be to use a secure marker pen, such as a UV light marker, to mark device surfaces and device openings so any tampering or replacement will be apparent. Criminals will often replace the outer casing of a device to hide their tampering, and these methods may help to detect such activities. Device vendors may also be able to provide security guidance and 'how to' guides to help determine whether the device has been tampered with. The frequency of inspections will depend on factors such as location of device and whether the device is attended or unattended. For example, devices left in public areas without supervision by the organization's personnel may have more frequent inspections than devices that are kept in secure areas or are supervised when they are accessible to the public.

A penetration test differs from a vulnerability scan, as a penetration test is an active process that may include exploiting identified vulnerabilities. Conducting a vulnerability scan may be one of the first steps a penetration tester will perform in order to plan the testing strategy, although it is not the only step. Even if a vulnerability scan does not detect known vulnerabilities, the penetration tester will often gain enough knowledge about the system to identify possible security gaps. Penetration testing is generally a highly manual process. While some automated tools may be used, the tester uses their knowledge of systems to penetrate into an environment. Often the tester will chain several types of exploits together with a goal of breaking through layers of defenses. For example, if the tester finds a means to gain access to an application server, they will then use the compromised server as a point to stage a new attack based on the resources the server has access to. In this way, a tester is able to simulate the methods performed by an attacker to identify areas of potential weakness in the environment.
