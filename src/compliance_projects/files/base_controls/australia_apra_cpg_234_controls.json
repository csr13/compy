In APRA\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s view, each dimension of the IT security risk management framework would be measured by at least one metric to enable the monitoring of progress towards set targets and the identification of trends.APRA envisages that the use of metrics would be targeted towards the areas of greatest criticality and sensitivity as determined through the risk assessment process. Effective metrics are specific, measurable, business-impact oriented, controllable and reportable.
